# 'Freeform Forms Field Type' for ExpressionEngine

This field type can be used to pick a Freeform form from those available in the [Solspace Freeform](https://solspace.com/software/expressionengine/freeform/) module. Useful if you want to add a form dynamically to an entry and allow the content author to pick the relevant form through the ExpressionEngine control panel. This field type also provides support for Grid and Blocks fields.
