# 'Freeform Forms Field Type' for ExpressionEngine

This field type can be used to pick a Freeform form from those available in the [Solspace Freeform](https://solspace.com/software/expressionengine/freeform/) module. Useful if you want to add a form dynamically to an entry and allow the content author to pick the relevant form through the ExpressionEngine control panel.
